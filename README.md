# An Unofficial Archive of Scratch Projects

Due to the Scratch Team planning to remove access to unshared projects (see [here](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/pull/6773)), I had the idea to archive as many old projects as possible with the purpose of preserving Scratch's community history.

## Progress

Shared Projects on Scratch: `>105,000,000` (From [Scratch Statistics](https://scratch.mit.edu/statistics/))  
Total Projects on Scratch: `>600,000,000`  

Projects Archived So Far: `100,000`  

Progress: `<0.1%`

## Opening Project Files

All project files are uploaded to The Internet Archive and can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/scratch-projects).

The files all are automatically downloaded with the `.sb3` extension for compatibility, but some older projects may not import correctly.  If Scratch fails to import a project, then attempt to switch the file extension to either `.sb2` or `.sb`.

## Contributing


Due to GitHub file limits, all archived files must be uploaded to [The Internet Archive]().


**1.** Clone this repository to your computer or a cloud machine.  
**2.** Run `npm install`.  
**3.** See what the most recent project is (the largest filename in the `projects` folder), then edit the `index.js` file's `initialIndex` and `finalIndex` variables accordingly.  
**4.** I recommend that you keep the `initialIndex` and `finalIndex`.  
**5.** Once you've downloaded a lot of files, make a commit with a message like this:
