# An Unofficial Archive of Scratch Projects

Due to the Scratch Team planning to remove access to unshared projects (see [here](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/pull/6773)), I had the idea to archive as many old projects as possible with the purpose of preserving Scratch's community history.

## Progress

Shared Projects on Scratch: `>105,000,000` (From [Scratch Statistics](https://scratch.mit.edu/statistics/))  
Total Projects on Scratch: `~600,000,000`  

Projects Archived So Far: `50,000`  

Progress: `<0.1%`

## Opening Project Files

All project files are uploaded to The Internet Archive and can be downloaed for free. See [this](#archives) section for the list of archives.

The files all are automatically downloaded with the `.sb3` extension for compatibility, but some older projects may not import correctly.  If Scratch fails to import a project, then attempt to switch the file extension to either `.sb2` or `.sb`.

## Contributing

Steps to contribute:

**1.** Clone this repository to your computer or a cloud machine.  
**2.** Run `npm install`.  
**3.** See what the most recent archived project is, then edit the `START` and `END` varibles in `index.js`.  
**4.** run or something  
**5.** Once you've downloaded some project files  
**6.** Change the `startId` & `endId` varibles and the path in `checkFiles.js`.  
**7.** run `checkFiles.js`  
**8.** Compress the project files as `.zip` to decrease the upload time and to save space. (use `.zip` only)  
**9.** Go to [The Internet Archive]() and create an account. (if you don't already have one)  
**10.** Create a new archive page and upload your `.zip` file.  
**11.** Create an issue with the link to the archive page, and the range of project IDs, so we can add it to the list below.  

Huge thanks to all contributers!
